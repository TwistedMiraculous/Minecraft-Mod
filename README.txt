# 🧪 Potion Pandemonium — A Minecraft Mod by Twisted

Welcome to **Potion Pandemonium**, my **very first Minecraft mod** — a chaotic little creation where potions fly, surprises lurk in every block, and things might get... *a little* out of hand. Whether you’re spicing up survival or trolling your friends just a bit, this mod has your back.

## 🎁 What’s Inside?

### 💥 Potion Block
Break it… if you dare! Every time you smash this custom block, you’ll be rewarded with a **completely random potion**.

Will it be:
- 🩹 Instant Health?
- 🕵️ Invisibility?
- ☠️ Something more... *explosive*?

There's no telling — and that's the fun.

### 🧱 Bonus Shenanigans
There are also a few **mysterious decorative blocks** included — you might use them to build something epic... or just stare at them. Your call.
